Years ago, I started to write a book about giving good conference talks. The
title was Speaking for Hackers. 

Turns out, I ran out of steam almost immediately, but I think what's here is
worth reading. You can probably get through all of it in far less time than it
takes to give a bad talk. 

The book is split into three sections: before, during, and after your talk.
There's also `raw_notes.txt` with rough ideas that never made it into a more
polished form.

Feel free to copy and share this, but please don't use it for anything
commercial without my permission.
