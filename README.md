This the source for Speaking for Hackers. 

Right now it's just plain text, wrapped to 80 characters. The eventual plan is for all the usual formats, including a nice-looking PDF.

As a paid customer, you should feel free to open up an issue describing the contet that you would like to see covered.

Contents: 

* If you'd like to see what's been added recently, check out the CHANGELOG.

* The book is split into before-your-talk.txt, during-your-talk.txt, and after-your-talk.txt.

* raw_notes.txt has the rough notes for things I'll cover in the future.
