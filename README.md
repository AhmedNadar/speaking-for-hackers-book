# Speaking for Hackers

Years ago, I started to write a book about giving good conference talks. The
title was Speaking for Hackers.

Turns out I ran out of steam and didn't finish, but I think what's here is
worth reading.

The book is split into three sections: before, during, and after your talk.
There's also some raw notes with ideas that never made it into polished prose.

Many thanks to my employer [thoughtbot](https://thoughtbot.com) for sending me
to the conferences where these ideas were developed.

Feel free to copy and share this, but please don't use it for anything
commercial without my permission.
