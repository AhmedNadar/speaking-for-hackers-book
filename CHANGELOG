3/4/2012:

* Merged in first pull request! Thanks @cgbystrom.

* Wrote up a section on introductions. See "Kill Your Introduction" for the
new content.


2/17/2012:

* Moved all content into a monolithic text file. I'll split this into
something resembling chapters later.

* Added a section on how to lay out a talk (summary: do a one sentence
introduction followed by your most important point)


2/9/2012:

* Added resources.txt with links to good blog posts and videos on speaking.


2/8/2012:

* Added sections on how to practice and pre-talk checklists.


2/6/2012:

* Added raw_notes.txt, which are...my raw notes on good public speaking. Most
of these were written in anger while sitting in crappy talks given by other
people. Lots of "do"s and "don't"s.

* Wrote up the first bit of prose in the book! I decided to start with the
most important stuff (something you should do in your talks too!).
prime_directive.txt lays out your MOST IMPORTANT job as speaker. Read this if
you skip EVERYTHING else.

* This little repo is up to 6 collaborators. If any of you have specific ideas
you'd like to see covered, I'd love for you to open an issue. Also, typo
corrections (or any improvements, really) through pull requests will be massively,
tremendously appreciated. Thanks!

* I shared Don't Be Boring as a blog post at
http://www.speakingforhackers.com/pages/dont-be-boring I'd love it if you'd
pass this link along to anyone who might be interested.
