* Why it's hard
  * short attention span
  * competing with the freaking INTERNET
    * best compliment: "I didn't look at my iphone the whole time"
* Don't be boring
  * Do something crazy in your intro to wake people up. I like to make them stand and stretch.
  * Your job is not to convey information, it is to convince people to learn. Make it seem exciting.
  * Whatever you do don't make it feel like a meeting.
  * Do stuff live
    * Show, don't tell
    * Write code live
    * Show code in an editor
      * Slides are finished-product still-lifes. An artist can learn a little from the end result, but more from the process.
        * After my talks, people always tell me they learned something about vim
        * I make a point of mentioning how I do cool stuff
      * Code in an editor feels alive
    * Improvise the details
      * Outlines are great, quotes are terrible
  * No one tuns out faster than a bored person
  * Be funny
    * Don't use the same tricks everyone else does: lolspeak, funny pictures
  * Don't use slides
  * Encourage questions
    * Confused people tune out too
  * Care about your topic
* Make damn sure your code is readable
  * if you ask "can you guys see this in the back?", you've failed
  * high-contrast shortcut
  * big font
  * check yourself, or ask people in the back row
  * nearly all projectors have horrible contrast. Grey WILL look like white.
* Spend one sentence on your introduction
  * An impressive bio does not make your talk any better
  * You don't need to establish you know what you're talking about. People have great bullshit sensors -- they'll know in no time.
* Front-load your content
  * People tune-out over time, so put the most important stuff first
* Give people an idea of where they are in your talk
* Make eye contact around the room
  * Most audiences have a 'nodder', focusing on this guy will boost your confidence
* Wait longer than you think you need to for questions
  * "Let's have a couple questions", not "any questions?"
* Be open
  * Talk about your doubts and fears (exception: DON'T say you're nervous to be speaking)
* Don't pre-apologize
* Repeat the question
* Close distracting stuff.
* How to handle a large group approaching your after the talk
  * acknowledge everyone early, shake hands, welcome them into the group
  * continue current thread
* How to write a good proposal
  * leveraging social proof
  * going beyond the norm - my RailsConf and Railsberry stories
* Speaking in your non-native language
* Choosing good time slots
* Negotiating talk lengths
* How to tell your talk will suck
* Ask for the smaller room.
* Get this remote!!! http://www.logitech.com/mice-pointers/presentation-remote/devices/5873
* Good body language / stage management
  * Don't walk around aimlessly.
  * Step off for emphasis or interest.
  * Good default hand position (by the sides, or elbows slightly bent for gesturing)
  * Hands behind back when taking questions
