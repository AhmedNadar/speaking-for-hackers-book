Practicing Your Talk

Practice talk in as close to live conditions as possible. Every variable that is different between your practicing and actual talk presents risk. 

One thing many speakers is that the resolution on their screen will be much lower than usual when plugged into a projector. It's an extremely good idea to drop your resolution to around 800x600 and run your entire talk. You'll be surprised at how many things you'll have to tweak.
