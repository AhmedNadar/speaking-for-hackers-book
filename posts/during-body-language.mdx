The pressure of the stage causes many of us to do odd things with our bodies.

I watched a talk recently where the speaker betrayed his nervousness by constantly fiddling with his badge (which he should have removed before speaking anyway).

Early in my speaking career, the discomfort of speaking caused me to talk for long periods of time with my eyes closed. Others often seem to not know what to do with their hands. Bad body language interferes with your talk. It can broadcast discomfort or nervousness.

Fortunately, having good body language while speaking is a simple affair: it mostly comes down to what to do with your hands. You have two options: down straight at your sides; or with your elbows bent around 100 degrees, gesturing naturally with palms up.

Nearly all other configurations with your arms can send messages you don't want, with one exception. When taking questions, feel free to place your hands behind your back and lean slightly forward. This is a listening posture and shows attentiveness toward your questioner.

Beyond your hands, remember to stand tall and look confident the moment you take the stage. Fake it 'til you make it applies here big-time.
