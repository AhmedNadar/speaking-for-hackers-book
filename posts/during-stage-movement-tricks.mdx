## A few recommendations for moving around on stage:

1. Do it, some. If you're using slides, you absolutely must have a remote slide advancer. Moving around a bit on stage makes your talk more dynamic, and keeps interest. I heartily recommend the Logitech E300 (**_double-check model number_**).

2. Don't do it too much, it diminishes the effect.

3. For important points, walk toward your audience a bit (I like to go out almost into the aisle), and STOP. Hold still while you make your important point, then resume moving. This adds excellent emphasis.

4. When you recieve a good question, take a step or two toward your listener. This shows encouragement. If you get an antagonistic question, you can achieve the opposite effect by taking a step backwards.
