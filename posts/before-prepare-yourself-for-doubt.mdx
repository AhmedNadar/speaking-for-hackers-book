As your talk approaches, it's totally normal to feel greater and greater doubts about how it's going to go.

I've told myself all of the following before a talk:

- "This is obvious to everyone."
- "I feel like a fraud."
- "There are no new ideas here."
- "My friends are going to think I suck."

Despite these doubts, I've usually gone on to give a satisfyingly-successful talk.

These days, I just expect these thoughts to pop into my head before a talk, and to be worst just before going on stage. It's still no fun that it happens, but now I'm mentally prepared and shrug it off.

When I talk to other speakers, they often admit to having the same thoughts. Don't freak out if you do too.
